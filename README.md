How Git Uses a Hash-Based Approach
Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem, where data (commits, trees, blobs) is stored and retrieved based on cryptographic hashes—specifically SHA-1 (160-bit, 40-character hexadecimal strings). This approach is key to its efficiency and can inspire a solution for your 1-trillion-commit problem.
Core Components
Commit Hash:
Every commit in Git has a unique SHA-1 hash (e.g., a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0).

The hash is computed from the commit’s content (message, author, timestamp, parent hashes, etc.).

Example: git commit generates this hash automatically.

Object Store:
Git stores all objects (commits, trees, blobs) in the .git/objects/ directory.

Structure: 
First 2 characters of the hash are the directory name.

Remaining 38 characters are the file name.

Example: Hash a1b2c3... → Stored as .git/objects/a1/b2c3d4....

Storage Format:
Objects are compressed (using zlib) and written to disk as files.

A commit object might look like (uncompressed):

commit 123
tree 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
parent 7c4e5f2a9b8d6e4f3c2d1e0f9a8b7c6d5e4f3c2d
author Alice <alice@example.com> 1711918800 -0700
committer Alice <alice@example.com> 1711918800 -0700

Fix bug in login

Lookup:
Given a hash (e.g., a1b2c3...), Git looks in .git/objects/a1/b2c3d4..., reads the file, and decompresses it.

Time complexity: O(1) via filesystem lookup.
